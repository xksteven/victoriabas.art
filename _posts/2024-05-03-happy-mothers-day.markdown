A poem for Victoria

```
In the dance of life, you shine so bright,
Victoria, my love, my heart's delight.
Fourteen years together, time's sweet bloom,
From vibrant laughter filling every room.

A mother now, with Sienna so small,
A perfect reflection, pale clone of all.
Your caring heart, a beacon so true,
Embracing family, in all you do.

From struggles faced with unyielding grace,
To every loving smile on your face.
Today we celebrate, just for you,
With breakfast in bed and cookies too.

A bubble bath, a house clean and neat,
Each moment with you is so sweet.
A Motherâ€™s Day filled with joy and cheer,
To remind you, my love, how much I care.
```
